My favorite CPSC 120L Labs

-Lab 5, part 1 This was a fun lab because we used for-loops to calculate the square root of -1. I had to learn how to calculate many different things such as square roots which was very difficult, but once I figured that out, it was easier to use it in a for-loop to calculate the answer.

-Lab 12 This was my favorite lab because I liked all the parts to this lab. In part 1, I used this lab to pull off many different tasks, such as the time machines and traveling the speed of light. In part 2, I wrote a program that allowed me to travel to other planets and galaxies.

-Lab 8, part 2 This was my second favorite lab because part 2 taught me how to play the game poker. I have always loved playing games on computers, and my program plays poker so well and I love that I was able to make something this cool.
