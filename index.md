I am a electrical engineering major at CSUF and plan to graduate in 2028

My favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 5, part 1 This was a fun lab because we used for-loops to calculate the square root of -1. I had to learn how to calculate many different things such as square rootswhich was very difficult, but once I figured that out, it was easier to use it in a for-loop to calculate the answer.

Lab 12 This was my favorite lab because I liked all the parts to this lab. In part 1, I used a time machine library to travel through time and correct the injustices of the past. In part 2, I wrote a program that allowed me to travel faster-than-light so I could visit distant solar systems.

Lab 8, part 2 This was my second favorite lab because part 2 taught me how to play the game poker. I have always been nterested in the game. My program plays poker so well that I have it playing against real people online and they can't tell the difference. My poker program has won over $1 billion bogus dollars.
